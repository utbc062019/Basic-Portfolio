                Hi I am Dawen Sui, call me D, or the greatest guy in the universe or multiverse. <i class="em em-laughing"></i> <i class="em em-laughing"></i>
                I hold a master degree in engineering not to brag and have worked the first half of my life as a professional engineer but finally got bored of it. 
                <br>I always think coding is cool but never got a chance to learn it and do it with my own hard. Now I am kind of semi retired also not as sharp as when I was younger. But
                finally I got a chance to try it. 
            </P>
